IMPORTANT! The frontend is in src/main/resources/templates/my-app

The project is written with Spring Boot(link:localhost:8080) and React(link:localhost:3000). The database is on localhost(a folder with it's name will be uploaded to the repository). I am using xampp to host it. The backend has full CRUD Operations for every Entity. The connection to the react project for now ensures adding, removing and getting articles. Since the last sprint there is a new CI script, unit tests for 2 of the controllers and all the models, update feature for articles in react and design updates. Also the database was changed as well as the design document.

As my laptop has issues temporally the CI will be failing.
